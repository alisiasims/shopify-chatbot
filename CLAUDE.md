# CLAUDE.md

## Deployment

- The app is deployed on **Railway** automatically from the `main` branch of this GitHub repo (`alisiasims/shopify-chatbot`).
- The database is a **Railway PostgreSQL** database, available only through the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on Railway.
- **Do not** set up a local database or run a local server. Everything runs on Railway.

## Workflow

- Before every push, run `npm run build` to make sure the app builds.
- After each finished task, commit and push to GitHub so that Railway deploys the new version.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide-React, Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL.
`build` = `prisma generate && next build`; `start` = `prisma migrate deploy && next start` (listens on `PORT`).
